> Simple webpage board game
 ## Rules
  - You can check them by watching this Numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSOSeRZVNg&t=313s&ab_channel=Numberphile
 ## General Information
  There are better technologies to make a game like this, however I wanted to improve my JS and HTML skills (all the things on the chessboard are being displayed by quite sophisticated changes in html code done by JS part)
 ## Setup
 For example you can use it following way:
 Download this repository. Open the whole project in Visual Studio Code. If you don't have already, you can download VSCode extension "Live Server". Then open the html file and right click on it. You will see list of options - choose Open with Live Server. You can now play the game.
